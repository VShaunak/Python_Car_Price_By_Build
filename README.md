# Python_Car_Price_By_Build

A machine learning Python model was created to predict the price of a car based on its price, model, aspiration, MPG, color, and other factors. A model was created to determine the price and was tested by training the model, resulting in an accuracy of 0.81 (0-1).

The following methods were used: Normalization, cleaning, wrangling, model development, prediction and decision making, model evaluation and refinement, over-under fitting.
Machine learning model: Regression, multiple regression, model testing, and model evaluation.

Feedback on this code is being sought. It is a model that was created to help predict the price of a car, and I would like to see how it could be improved. I am open to feedback on all aspects, from the methods that were used to the code structure.

Here are some specific questions:

* Are there any methods that could be used to improve the accuracy of the model?
* Is there a better way to structure the code?
* Are there any potential problems with the code that I should be aware of?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
